            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Alejandro Vallin Romo. <br>What can I do for you? </p>
			<p>I'm a Business Intelligence Consultant and Data Analyst, certified in Data Science for Business.</p>
            <p>A Graduate in Engineering Physics from the University of Colorado, Boulder and a former University Professor; I have experience transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. 
                My expertise lies in statistical analysis, data visualization, and data management.</p>

                    <p>Developed interactive Sales Analysis Dashboards designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance. 
                        The following examples are built using Power BI and feature interactive visualizations and filters that allow users to explore the data generated by their customer and products across different time frames, sales regions, among other metrics. 
                        Analyzing how the top customers are buying in comparison to previous trends, as well as the current business plan, enables the company to monitor progress, identify risks and opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.</p>

                                               Again a “(?)” help button is present, as well as a “Show/Hide Weekly Analysis” (in this screenshot is displayed) for a more detailed analysis of the week-by-week business plan.">
