            <p>Hello! I'm Alejandro Vallin Romo. <br>What can I do for you? </p>
			<p>I'm a Business Intelligence Consultant and Data Analyst, certified in Data Science for Business.</p>
            <p>A Graduate in Engineering Physics from the University of Colorado, Boulder and a former University Professor; I have experience transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. 
                My expertise lies in statistical analysis, data visualization, and data management.</p>

                    <p>Developed interactive Sales Analysis Dashboards designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance. 
                        The following examples are built using Power BI and feature interactive visualizations and filters that allow users to explore the data generated by their customer and products across different time frames, sales regions, among other metrics. 
                        Analyzing how the top customers are buying in comparison to previous trends, as well as the current business plan, enables the company to monitor progress, identify risks and opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.</p>

                    <p>Developed interactive dashboards to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications provider. 
                        The focus was on identifying the key factors influencing churn, as well as locations where customers are most likely to leave. 
                        This analysis provided actionable insights to help the business enhance customer retention strategies and reduce churn by addressing underlying issues effectively.
                        These Dashboards where made using data provided by the Company, including customer data and, when applicable, exit surveys.</p>

                                The pie chart on the left reveals that nearly 45% of customers gave an answer related to a competitor. 
                                Let’s also notice, on the “Churn Reasons” visual that the third most common reason is “Attitude of support person”. 
                                This issue warrants immediate attention. Lastly, the map highlights an unusually high churn rate in California. 
                                Let’s explore this a bit further by clicking on the California bubble.">

                                Unfortunately, the main Churn Reason for this state seems to be left blank. 
                                This is concerning as it could mean departing customers may not be receiving exit surveys, or they may be unwilling to complete them; 
                                both of which could hinder our understanding of why customers are leaving.">
                            <img src="images/churnrate_insights1.png" 
                                alt="Churn Rate insights Dashboard"

                                data-caption="This second Dashboard explores the number of customer service calls made on each state among other factors such as extra data charges per customer. 
                                Notice on the top-right map, that California stands out with its bubble being the greenest in color, and also is one of the largest, indicating a high Churn Rate paired with a low volume of customer service calls. 
                                This suggests that despite customer dissatisfaction, they may not be reaching out for assistance. 
                                Let’s investigate this further by clicking on the California bubble.">

                                data-caption="After clicking on the bubble we can see a clear pattern: 
                                although California has the highest Churn Rate of any state, it also had the least number of customer service calls by far. 
                                This discrepancy suggests a unique issue with customer service in California that isn’t present in other states. 
                                I recommend reaching out to the customer service team in California about these issues and develop a targeted improvement plan.">

                                data-caption="This third Dashboard explores an unrelated insight which was interesting to also include in the report. 
                                We can see on the upper-left visual that customers older than 60 are highly likely to churn. 
                                If we go back to the first Dashboard we can see that the “Deceased” Churn Reason only accounts for 0.3%, and does not explain the trend. 
                                Additionally, the lower-left visual reveals that customers on a group plan are less likely to leave. 
                                Based on these insights, I propose reaching out to our older customers to encourage them to join group plans, potentially improving retention in this demographic.">

                                This trend suggests that some customers are overestimating their data needs, and later regret their choice of the Unlimited Plan. 
                                I propose reaching out to these customers with a personalized offer to downgrade to a pay-per-usage plan, clearly outlining the potential cost savings to them, this will improve their retention.">
